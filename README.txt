SQL Server Profiler 
===================
almost(maybe better) clone of original SQL server profiler, but as you see it is open source :)

* Requires .net 4.0
* I just took it from somewhere else when this was an open source project and cleaned it a bit. Works for me.


Form whom didn't work with profiler and traces:
Be adviced however, that at least in my experience it generates lots of small .trc files which may sum up to take a lot of space.
